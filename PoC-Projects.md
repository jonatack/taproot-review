# Proof of Concept Projects

Here are some ideas for proof-of-concept projects to explore schnorr and/or
taproot in more depth.

 * LN payment points and scalars
 * LN 2-of-2 schnorr MuSig construction for channel open/close
 * Off-chain 2-of-3 key rotation
 * Liquid-style 11-of-15 multisig
 * Taproot/schnorr support for python-bitcoinlib (etc?)
 * Taproot/schnorr support for bitcoinjs-lib?
 * ...

Note: Optech has developed a [schnorr & taproot
library](https://github.com/bitcoinops/taproot-workshop), which can be used to
prototype many of the proof-of-concept projects suggested above. The library
features a schnorr and MuSig implementation as well as methods to construct
taproot outputs from various types of tapscripts. The documentation is written
in the form of interactive jupyter notebooks which provide thorough examples on
how to use the library.
